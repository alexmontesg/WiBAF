                    <p class="strong">Questions to think about</p>
                    <p>
                        In some ways, making a decision to tell the university officially about your autism is a simple one with obvious benefits and clear boundaries. Disclosing means you can access support. They tell you what information and evidence, they need from you and they can't pass any information on without your permission. You can tell them any time, but if you tell them as soon as you can it's better for everyone. With other groups of people and individuals it's less clear, and the right path for you is something you need to work out for yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are some questions that might help you to think about it.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            When are you going to tell people?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Who are you going to tell?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How are you going to tell them? (in person, on the phone, via email/text/social media, in a group, on their own)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How much are you going to tell them?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Can you trust this person?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Does this person have your best interest at heart?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do you mind if they tell other people?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="strong">Talking about your autism</p>
                    <p>
                        In the past, your parents or teachers or other people who helped you might have done most of the talking â€“ they knew all about you and could help explain to other people how an autistic spectrum condition affected you socially and educationally. At university, while you can ask for support from the disability office and other people, and some paperwork can be passed on to your department, it's your responsibility to not just tell people about your diagnosis but to explain to them what that means for you. Even if somebody knows about autism and Asperger Syndrome, it doesn't mean they know how it will affect you or that they are aware that there are positives as well as negatives to the condition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        90% of parents in our Autism &amp; Uni survey said they had to advocate for their children so they could receive the support they need at school. Students in the surveys said they find it difficult to explain difficulties related to their autism, which might partly be because before uni other people were on hand to do it for them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So it's really important to think about not just who you tell or how, but what you tell people who can help you and how comfortable you feel with explaining your needs. It's like learning how to complain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best way to complain is to:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            State the problem clearly and unemotionally (for example: "I found a hair in my sandwich").
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Explain without getting angry what the consequences were for you ("I didn't get to have any lunch that day because I didn't have time to come back to the shop").
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How are you going to tell them? (in person, on the phone, via email/text/social media, in a group, on their own)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Tell the person you're complaining to:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Exactly what you'd like them to do about it without being rude (for example: apologise, give you a full refund, make sure staff are trained on this issue)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    When you need it doing by (for example: Friday 5pm, the end of the month, within 48 hours and so on).
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Then it's easy for the person responding to agree and make things right. You have to make it similarly clear and easy for people to understand and help you when you have an issue related to your autism, but it's hard not to get emotional or angry.
                    </p>
