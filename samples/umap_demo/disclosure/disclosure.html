                <section>
                    <p class="strong">Disclosure is a necessary part of getting academic/financial support</p>
                    <p>
                        Whether or not you apply for Disabled Students Allowance (DSA - LINK) and get any financial support to help with your studies, the university needs to know that you have an autistic spectrum condition in order to make any ‘reasonable adjustments'. If you need extra time in your exams, a different location for exams, longer library loans and access to study spaces for disabled students, you need to tell the uni. You will usually need DSA to pay for things that cost money like mind mapping software,  equipment for recording lectures, note takers and specialist mentors.
                    </p>
                    <p class="strong">Getting support early enough</p>
                    <p>
                        Starting uni is an exciting time, but like any change is stressful for anyone. It can be particularly stressful if you are on the autistic spectrum because it involves so much uncertainty. It's also a very busy time for the university, with lots of new students arriving and familiar ones returning. Getting the support you need in those first few weeks, even simple things like someone showing you around  all the places where your lectures will be held can be really important. In our surveys, lots of students didn't tell anyone they were autistic until they were already really struggling, and that can be too late for it not to have an effect on you and your work. It takes time to process applications for support and send information to the relevant people, so the earlier you can do it the better. You don't have to wait for your results. You can get started with help from your firm choice university now – even if you end up going somewhere else.
                    </p>
                    <p class="strong">Why don't some students disclose?</p>
                    <p>
                        Many autistic students don't identify as disabled, so they don't tick the disability box on the UCAS form or any other paperwork. Even if they never need support or reasonable adjustments, it's helpful for the university to know how many autistic students they have so they can take the needs of people on the spectrum into account when designing and updating buildings, courses and services.
                    </p>
                    <p class="strong">What happens when students don't disclose?</p>
                    <p>
                        Autistic students are more likely than other students to drop out of university.  When we surveyed people with experience of attending and/or completing university, over 70% said never told anyone they were autistic. Some of them were not diagnosed until after university. Students who were diagnosed before or during university and disclosed their autism were more likely to finish their course and get good grades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Those students who dropped out told us it was because they realise now they needed support with some aspects of university. Even though in general they got good marks when they submitted work, they struggled to manage on their own, especially early in the course. They felt that they were unintentionally bullied or excluded by other students, who would have been more understanding if they knew that they had autism. Several students who dropped out went back and completed university later, and they had a better experience because people knew they were autistic and they were able to access support and get on better socially.
