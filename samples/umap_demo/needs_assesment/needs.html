                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>
                        This activity explains the Study Needs Assessment. This is an important part of the process of claiming Disabled Students Allowance and getting support at university.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Welcome – Who we are</h4>
                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Kate and I am the Access Adviser you will be meeting at your Study Needs Assessment appointment at Leeds Beckett’s Disability Assessment Centre. You may also meet Kirsty, our Assessment Centre Administrator, Sharon our other Access Adviser or another Kate, who is the Assessment Centre Manager.If you have any access needs or preferences to enable you to fully participate in the assessment, please do let us know. It is very important to us that you are able to express your views and opinionsso that we can ensure you get the most out of this process and that the recommendations we make are appropriate to your individual requirements.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Where will we meet</h4>
                    <p>
                        We will meet at Headingley Campus, in the Priestley building. When you arrive for your assessment, you can wait in our reception area.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../images/image11.jpeg" />
                    <p>I will collect you from reception and take you to room G02 where the assessment will take place. </p>
                    <img src="../images/image12.jpeg" />
                    <h4>What is the Study Needs Assessment?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Study Needs Assessment tends to be a structured but fairly informal 1:1 discussion with an Access Adviser and Study Needs Assessor which will usually last between 1.5 and 2 hours. We have specific questions we need to ask, but it will feel like a chat rather than an interrogation. You willhave the opportunity to talk about strategies you have already developed and support you have found useful in the past as well as exploring any additional support that is available to you throughout your degree programme. This enables me to write a report and make recommendations that form the basis of the support you will go on to receive.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <h4>What will we talk about?</h4>
                    <p>Firstly, I will introduce myself, offer you a drink and try to ensure you are comfortable in the environment. I will then check your personal details and explain to you what will happen during the assessment. We will talk about:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            your autism spectrum condition and any other disabilities, specific learning difficulties or long term medical conditions you may have.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            your previous education or employment experiences and any support you have found useful so far.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the information you provided us with prior to your assessment  (e.g. educational psychologist’s assessment report and/or medical evidence).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            your pre-assessment questionnaire.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We will then talk about the course you have chosen to study and each area of your study in depth in order to identify any impact your autism is likely to have on the way you learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we will talk about the specialist support and equipment available to you at university. I will show you some of the assistive software and equipment, and in some cases you may also be able to try it out.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What types of recommendations might be made?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Recommendations for support will depend on your individual circumstances and must be considered in relation to the DSA regulations and guidance. Recommendations will vary from person to person, depending on their course, their disability and the impact their disability is likely to have on theirstudies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the assessment you will have the opportunity to ask questions or suggest strategies or equipment that you feel you may benefit from. I will discuss these with you, along with any other support or adjustments I think would be appropriate and beneficial for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This could include some human support, usually delivered on a 1:1 basis, such as mentoring or study skills support. There is a range of specialist equipment or assistive technology, such as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            mindmapping software to help you plan your work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            text-to-speech software to assist you in reading and processing information and proofreading your work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            dictation software to assist you in composing your work.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Some links to examples of the available software are included at the end of this activity, should you wish to look at them before your appointment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I may also make recommendations for your course team and Disability Adviser to consider, such as examination recommendations, extended library loans or ensuring you are provided with handouts prior to classes.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What happens next</h4>
                    <p>
                        I will write your report, and a copy will be sent to you within 10 working days. We will also send a copy to your funding body and, with your permission, your Disability Advice team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I will talk to you in more detail at the appointment about what you should expect to happen after your appointment and I will give you some information that you can take home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We’re looking forward to meeting you at your appointment but if you have any questions in the meantime or if you would like some further information please do contact us.
                    </p>
