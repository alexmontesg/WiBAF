                		<p>We’re talking about disclosure here because so many students don’t tell anybody at uni about their autism, not even the university itself. This makes it difficult for them to get the support they need, both officially and from their friends and the other people around them. At school or college, you might not have received or even needed any support outside your family, and the opportunity to reinvent yourself at uni means you don’t have to tell anyone about your diagnosis. However, university is very different from school and college and the help available can level the playing field so you can concentrate on enjoying your time at uni and doing well on your course.</p>

                		<h4 id="meant">What do we mean by disclosure?</h4>
                		<p>‘Disclosure’ in this context means telling people that you have a disability. You might not consider your autism to be a disability, but that’s how organisations like universities categorise it so they can understand their students and give them support if they need it. Telling the university you have autism does not mean that you have to tell everyone you meet if you don’t want to, and nor does it mean that you will be forced to accept support you don’t want or need. </p>

                		<h4 id="whyopent">Why is it a good thing to be open about autism?</h4>
                		<p>Our Autism &amp; Uni research found that people who disclosed their autism and got appropriate support were more likely to finish their courses and get the grades they expected. Several students told us that if their friends knew about autism, they were able to help them when they felt stressed out or anxious, and it gave them an explanation for why they were worried or frustrated. Tutors and teachers told us that if they were aware of the difficulties autistic students were facing and the things they were worried about, they would understand what was going on in situations and could make some small changes to the way they work that would help.</p>

                		<p>Whether or not you apply for Disabled Students Allowance (DSA - LINK) and get any financial support to help with your studies, the university needs to know that you have an autistic spectrum condition in order to make any ‘reasonable adjustments’. If you need extra time in your exams, a different location for exams, longer library loans and access to study spaces for disabled students, you need to tell the uni. You will usually need DSA to pay for things that cost money like mind mapping software,  equipment for recording lectures, note takers and specialist mentors.</p>

                		<p>Starting uni is an exciting time, but like any change is stressful for anyone. It can be particularly stressful if you are on the autistic spectrum because it involves so much uncertainty. It’s also a very busy time for the university, with lots of new students arriving and familiar ones returning. Getting the support you need in those first few weeks, even simple things like someone showing you around  all the places where your lectures will be held can be really important. In our surveys, lots of students didn’t tell anyone they were autistic until they were already really struggling, and that can be too late for it not to have an effect on you and your work. It takes time to process applications for support and send information to the relevant people, so the earlier you can do it the better. You don’t have to wait for your results. You can get started with help from your firm choice university now – even if you end up going somewhere else.</p>

                		<h4 id="whydontt">Why don’t some students disclose?</h4>
                		<p>Many autistic students don’t identify as disabled, so they don’t tick the disability box on the UCAS form or any other paperwork. Even if they never need support or reasonable adjustments, it’s helpful for the university to know how many autistic students they have so they can take the needs of people on the spectrum into account when designing and updating buildings, courses and services.</p>

                		<h4 id="whathappenst">What happens when students don’t disclose?</h4>
                		<p>Autistic students are more likely than other students to drop out of university.  When we surveyed people with experience of attending and/or completing university, over 70% said never told anyone they were autistic. Some of them were not diagnosed until after university. Students who were diagnosed before or during university and disclosed their autism were more likely to finish their course and get good grades.</p>
						<p>Those students who dropped out told us it was because they realise now they needed support with some aspects of university. Even though in general they got good marks when they submitted work, they struggled to manage on their own, especially early in the course. They felt that they were unintentionally bullied or excluded by other students, who would have been more understanding if they knew that they had autism. Several students who dropped out went back and completed university later, and they had a better experience because people knew they were autistic and they were able to access support and get on better socially.</p>

                		<h4 id="whofindsoutt">When I disclose, who will find out?</h4>
                		<p>Telling the university that you have autism doesn’t mean you have to tell everyone – it’s a confidential process. They won’t tell other students and they will ask you before sharing any information with other parts of the university like your department. It also doesn’t mean that every member of staff automatically knows everything, even if you do agree for the information to be passed on.</p>
						<p>Sometimes tutors are given lots of information from the disability office or the disability contact in the department, sometimes not much, and it doesn’t always help the tutor understand how your autism affects you in relation to the course or specific assignments. Knowing that you are anxious about social situations, for example, doesn’t tell them that in group work, you are worried you will have to do all the work or that you might feel left out in discussions</p>
						<p>It’s good to agree that the information is passed on, but you will still probably have to do some of the legwork yourself, and just because your fellow students don’t have to know you are on the autistic spectrum, it doesn’t mean that it wouldn’t be helpful for you to tell them.</p>

                	<section id="startdisclosure">
                		<h4 id="startdisclosuret">Getting started with disclosure</h4>
                		<p>In the UK, official disclosure often starts with ticking the ‘disability’ box on the UCAS form and choosing the right category when you apply for uni. You can tell the university earlier than this if you’re going to an Open Day or other event before applying, or later if you’ve already applied via UCAS or are already at uni. The universities you apply to will then usually contact you for more information.</p>
						<p>The disability office at the university you pick as your firm choice, or at your current uni if you are already studying, will be able to tell you more about what information will be needed and how the process works where you are. You can tell the university at any point in your studies, but if you contact them at busy times like close to exams or dissertation hand-ins then it’s a bit more difficult for disability support to make sure you get help quickly, particularly if you need adjustments like extra time in exams.</p>

                		<p>If you don’t have an official diagnosis, unfortunately it’s harder for the university to help you because funding for disabled students is based on needing a diagnosis and evidence of that diagnosis. Please talk to the disability office at your uni as they can tell you what they can and can’t do for you – some adjustments can be made without funding and it still helps academic staff and others to understand you and the way you work if they know that you are on the autistic spectrum.</p>

                		<h4 id="questionst">Questions to think about</h4>
                		<p>In some ways, making a decision to tell the university officially about your autism is a simple one with obvious benefits and clear boundaries. Disclosing means you can access support. They tell you what information and evidence, they need from you and they can’t pass any information on without your permission. You can tell them any time, but if you tell them as soon as you can it’s better for everyone. With other groups of people and individuals it’s less clear, and the right path for you is something you need to work out for yourself.</p>
                		<p>Here are some questions that might help you to think about it. (THIS BIT COULD BE MORE INTERACTIVE)</p>
                		<ul>
                			<li>When are you going to tell people?</li>
                			<li>Who are you going to tell?</li>
							<li>How are you going to tell them? (in person, on the phone, via email/text/social media, in a group, on their own)</li>
                			<li>How much are you going to tell them?</li>
                			<li>Can you trust this person?</li>
                			<li>Does this person have your best interest at heart?</li>
                			<li>Do you mind if they tell other people?</li>

                		<h4 id="talking1t">Talking about your autism Part 1</h4>
                		<p>In the past, your parents or teachers or other people who helped you might have done most of the talking – they knew all about you and could help explain to other people how an autistic spectrum condition affected you socially and educationally. At university, while you can ask for support from the disability office and other people, and some paperwork can be passed on to your department, it’s your responsibility to not just tell people about your diagnosis but to explain to them what that means for you. Even if somebody knows about autism and Asperger Syndrome, it doesn’t mean they know how it will affect you or that they are aware that there are positives as well as negatives to the condition.</p>
 						<p>90% of parents in our Autism&amp;Uni survey said they had to advocate for their children so they could receive the support they need at school. Students in the surveys said they find it difficult to explain difficulties related to their autism, which might partly be because before uni other people were on hand to do it for them.</p>
						<p>QUOTES</p>

                		<h4 id="talking2t">Talking about your autism Part 2</h4>
                		<p>So it’s really important to think about not just who you tell or how, but what you tell people who can help you and how comfortable you feel with explaining your needs. It’s like learning how to complain.</p>
						<p>The best way to complain is to:</p>
                		<ol>
                			<li>State the problem clearly and unemotionally (for example: ”I found a hair in my sandwich”).</li>
                			<li>Explain without getting angry what the consequences were for you (“I didn’t get to have any lunch that day because I didn’t have time to come back to the shop”).</li>
							<li>How are you going to tell them? (in person, on the phone, via email/text/social media, in a group, on their own)</li>
                			<li>Tell the person you’re complaining to:
                				<ol>
                					<li>Exactly what you’d like them to do about it without being rude (for example: apologise, give you a full refund, make sure staff are trained on this issue)</li>
                					<li>When you need it doing by (for example: Friday 5pm, the end of the month, within 48 hours and so on).</li>
                				</ol>
                			</li>
                		</ol>
                		<p>Then it’s easy for the person responding to agree and make things right. You have to make it similarly clear and easy for people to understand and help you when you have an issue related to your autism, but it’s hard not to get emotional or angry. (THIS COULD USE ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF PRESENTATION LIKE A COMIC OR ANIMATION)</p>
