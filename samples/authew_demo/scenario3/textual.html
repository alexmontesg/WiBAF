					<h4>Welcome</h4>

					<p>
						Hello my name is Kate and I am the Access Adviser you will
						be meeting at your Study Needs Assessment appointment.
					</p>

					<p>
						You may also meet Kirsty, our Assessment Centre
						Administrator, Sharon our other Access Adviser and Kate, The Assessment Centre Manager.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you have any access requirements or preferences to enable
						you to fully participate in the assessment please do let us know, using the
						contact details shown on this slide. It is very important to us that you are
						able to express your views and opinions so that we can ensure you get the most
						out of this process and that the recommendations we make are appropriate to
						your individual requirements.
					</p>

					<h4>Where
					will we meet</h4>
					<p>
						We will meet at the Headingley Campus, Priestly Building.
						When you arrive for your assessment you can wait in our reception area. I will
						collect you from reception and take you to room G02 where the assessment will
						take place

					<h4>What is the Study Needs Assessment?</h4>
					<p>
						The study needs assessment tends to be a structured but fairly informal 1:1
						discussion with an Access Adviser and Study Needs Assessor which will usually
						last between 1.5 and 2 hours. You will have the opportunity to talk about
						strategies you have already developed and support you have found useful in the
						past as well as exploring any additional support that is available to you
						throughout your degree programme.
					</p>
					<h4>What will we talk about?</h4>
					<p>
						Firstly, I will introduce myself, offer you a drink and try
						to ensure you are comfortable in the environment. I will then check your
						personal details and explain to you what will happen during the assessment. We
						will talk about:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							your Disability
						</li>
						<li>
							your previous education or employment
							experiences and any support you have found useful
						</li>
						<li>
							the information you provided us with prior to
							your assessment (e.g. Educational Psychologists Assessment Report and/or Medical Evidence)
						</li>
						<li>
							your pre-assessment
							questionnaire.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						We will then talk about the course you have chosen to study
						and each area of your study in depth in order to identify any impact your
						disability is likely to have on the way you learn.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, we will talk about the specialist support and
						equipment available to you at University, I will show you some of the assistive
						software and equipment, and in some cases you may also be able to try it out.
					</p>
					<h4>How to prepare for the assessment</h4>
					<p>
						Itâ€™s a good idea to think about your strengths and
						weaknesses. Write this down as a list of bullet points and bring it to the
						meeting.
					</p>

						studies or in the work place and/or challenging experiences you have had. Also

					<h5>Your strengths and preferences</h5>
					<p>
						Also make notes about your strengths and preferences in
						those areas, as that will help academic staff to support and understand you.
					</p><h4>What
					types of recommendations might be made?</h4>
					<p>
						Recommendations for support will depend on your individual
						circumstances and must be considered in relation to the DSA regulations and
						guidance. Recommendations will vary from person to person, depending on their
						course, their disability and the impact their disability is likely to have on
						their studies.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the assessment you will have the opportunity to ask
						questions or suggest strategies or equipment that you feel you may benefit
						from. I will discuss these with you, along with any other support or
						adjustments I think would be appropriate and beneficial for you.
					</p>
					<p>
						This could include some human support, usually delivered on
						a 1:1 basis, such as mentoring or study skills support. Specialist equipment or
						assistive technology, such as mindmapping software to assist in planning your work, text
						to speech software to assist you in reading and processing information and
						proofreading your work and dictate software to assist you in composing your
						work. Some links to examples of the available software are included at the end
						of this presentation, should you wish to look at them before your appointment.
					</p>
					<p>
						I may also make recommendations for your course team and
						University Disability Adviser to consider, such as, examination
						recommendations, extended library loans or ensuring you are provided with
						handouts prior to classes.
					</p><h4>What happens next</h4>
					<p>
						I will write your report and a copy will be sent to you
						within 10 working days, we will also send a copy to your funding body and with
						your permission, your University Disability Advice team.
					</p>
					<p>
						I will talk to you in more detail at the appointment about
						what you should expect to happen after your appointment and I will give you
						some information to take away with you.
					</p>
					<p>
						Weâ€™re looking forward to meeting you at your appointment but
						if you have any questions in the meantime or if you would like some further
						information please do contact us.
