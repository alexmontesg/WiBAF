            <h2>The AHA! User Model</h2>

            <p>
                For every individual user AHA! maintains a <em>user model</em>,
                consisting of <em>concepts</em> with <em>attributes</em>.
                As an author you never deal with the user model directly,
                but influence the possible updates to the model through the
                <a href="concepts.xhtml" class="conditional">concept structure</a> and the
                associated
                <span class="DomainAdaptationModel-visited"> event-condition-action rules</span>.
                Whether the user model is stored in the form of XML files or
                in the mySQL database, it contains the same information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There is a <em>pseudo concept</em> called <strong>personal</strong>
                    which represents information about the user, independent of the
                    application domain.
                    It can have arbitrarily many attributes that are created through
                    an application's registration form.
                    If the registration form contains a form field:
                    <pre>
&lt; input type="hidden" name="myattribute" value="mystring" /&gt;
</pre>
                    then an attribute <tt>myattribute</tt> will be added to the
                    concept <tt>personal</tt> and it will get the value <tt>mystring</tt>.
                    Of course you can use any other type of field
                    (e.g. text instead of hidden) to let the
                    user enter information in the field.
                    <br />
                    The concept <tt>personal</tt> can be used like any other concept.
                    Attribute values can be used in
                    <span class="DomainAdaptationModel-visited"> event-condition-action rules</span>
                    to create
                    behavior that depends on the information a user entered in the
                    registration form.
                    But apart from author-chosen attributes that have no other meaning
                    than their use in rules there are some predefined
                    attributes of the <tt>personal</tt> concept that have a meaning for AHA!:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <tt>name</tt>: This is the end-user's name, entered in the registration form.
                            The name can be included in a
                            <a href="headerfooter.xhtml" class="conditional">header or footer</a>,
                            using the <tt>&lt;username/&gt;</tt> variable.
                            Anonymous users do not have a name, although a standard name can be
                            created through the registration form.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>email</tt>: This is the end-user's email address,
                            entered in the registration form.
                            The address can be included in a header or footer using the
                            <tt>&lt;email/&gt;</tt> variable.
                            Anonymous users do not have an email address.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>id</tt>: This the login id chosen by the end-user or generated
                            automatically for an anonymous user. The login id can be included
                            in a header using the <tt>&lt;loginid&gt;</tt> variable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>password</tt>: This is the end-user's password.
                            In AHA! 2.0 the password is not stored in encrypted form.
                            As a result access to the directory with the user models (in XML format)
                            or to the mySQL database should be restricted.
                            Anonymous users cannot have a password.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>university</tt>: This is one of the attributes that date back
                            to the original application area: on-line courses offered to
                            several universities. Of course it can be used to represent
                            something else, like the end-user's company.
                            This attribute can be included in a header using the
                            <tt>&lt;university&gt;</tt> variable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>department</tt>: This is the second attribute for courses.
                            It can represent the end-user's department, course major,
                            or anything else.
                            This attribute can be included in a header using the
                            <tt>&lt;department&gt;</tt> variable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>course</tt>: Each AHA! application is identified as a "course"
                            (for historical reasons). This attribute is also the name of the
                            subdirectory of an AHA! server containing the application.
                            This attribute can be included in a header using the
                            <tt>&lt;course&gt;</tt> variable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>title</tt>: Each AHA! application can be identified using a "title".
                            This attribute can be included in a header using the
                            <tt>&lt;coursename&gt;</tt> variable. (Not "title" for implementation
                            reasons.)
                            In this tutorial the header shows "knowledge of AHA! tutorial".
                            The part "AHA! tutorial" is the title of this application.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>goodlink</tt>: This is the color used for links to <em>suitable</em>
                            pages that have not been visited. It is a string value representing
                            the RGB value of the color as a hexadecimal number.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>neutrallink</tt>: This is the color used for links to previously
                            visited <em>suitable</em> pages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>badlink</tt>: This is the color of links to <em>unsuitable</em> pages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>activelink</tt>: This is the color of links while the mouse button
                            is pressed to follow the link.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>externallink</tt>: This is the color of links to external
                            pages that have not been visited.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <tt>externalvisitedlink</tt>: This is the color of links to visited
                            external pages.

                        <li>
                            <tt>background</tt>: This is the name for the background image used
                            on every page. (In the tutorial this is "/aha/AHAtutorialLS/icons/tuebg.gif".)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    All other concepts belong to the application domain.
                    The <a href="concepts.xhtml" class="conditional">concept structure</a>
                    determines which concepts exist and which attributes they have.
                    For every attribute of a concept the user model stores: the <em>type</em>
                    of the attribute (Boolean, integer or string), the <em>value</em>,
                    and a Boolean to indicate whether the attribute value is <em>persistent</em>.
