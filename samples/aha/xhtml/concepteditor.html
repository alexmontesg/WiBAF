<h2>The Concept Editor</h2>

<p>
The Concept Editor is an authoring tool for defining concepts and
<if expr="AHAtutorialLS.DomainAdaptationModel.knowledge&gt;50">
<block>
event-condition-action rules.
</block>
<block>
adaptation rules.
</block>
</if>
We briefly describe the use of the Concept Editor here,
using a series of screen dumps to guide you through the process.
We assume that you are already familiar with the
<a href="graphauthor.xhtml" class="conditional">Graph Author</a>
which is easier to use and intended for less technical authors.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When you start the Concept Editor it asks for a login and password.
<if expr="AHAtutorialLS.graphauthor.knowledge &gt; 0">
<block>
As of AHA! 2.0 authors are identified and have separate work spaces.
The manager can add new authors, either as part of the
<a href="install.xhtml" class="conditional">initial installation</a>
or at a later time using the
<a href="ahaconfig.xhtml" class="conditional">configuration</a> menu.
</block>
</if>
</li>
<li>
After logging in the
<a href="/aha/AHAtutorialLS/images/concepteditor.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">main Concept Editor window</a>
appears. Through the "File" menu you can create a new application,
open an existing one and save it.
</li>
<li>
Unlike with the Graph Author the Concept Editor shows concepts
with their full name which includes the application name.
The Graph Author hides the application name, but does generate it
when you save the application.
</li>
<li>
The Concept Editor shows a complete list of concepts (not a hierarchy
like the Graph Editor does). Each concept can be "opened up" to reveal
its attributes. The
<a href="/aha/AHAtutorialLS/images/conceptlist.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">list of concepts with attributes</a> resembles
a windows explorer view.
A <a href="templates.xhtml" class="conditional">template</a> determines
which attributes are created automatically for every new concept.
</li>
<li>
When selecting a concept the Concept Editor shows information about
the concept, including the <em>requirement</em> for the concept
to be <em>suitable</em>.
For the <a href="/aha/AHAtutorialLS/images/welcomeconcept.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">welcome concept</a> from this tutorial we
have a screendump of what would be shown.
</li>
<li>
One can select an attribute (or create one) and then edit the
<a href="rules.xhtml">adaptation rules</a> associated with that attribute.
The <a href="/aha/AHAtutorialLS/images/accessattribute.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">access attribute screendump</a>
shows the following information (and more):
<ul>
<li>
<b>Type</b>: Each attribute is of type "int", "string" or "bool".
</li>
<li>
<b>Changeable</b>: This flag indicates whether the end-user is allowed
to change the value of the attribute (through a form) or not.
</li>
<li>
<b>Persistent</b>: This flag indicates whether the attribute value
is used during the rule execution for one event (page access) only,
or whether the value is retained, like for "knowledge" for instance.
</li>
<li>
<b>System</b>: This flag indicates whether the attribute has a special
meaning to the AHA! system. The <em>access</em> attribute for instance
has the special meaning that it temporarily becomes true when the
page is accessed.
</li>
<li>
<b>Generate list item</b>: Each line in this list contains the condition
of an adaptation rule.
You can select a condition and then edit the rule.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The <a href="/aha/AHAtutorialLS/images/rulescreendump.gif" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">adaptation rule form</a> shows that for
a rule the condition can be edited, the action to be performed
if the condition is true and the optional action if the condition
is false. Through the "Propagating" flag you can indicate that
changes made to the user model by this rule may trigger other rules.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that most authors will never need to use the Concept Editor.
The entire concept and rule structure for this tutorial was created
using only the Graph Author.
