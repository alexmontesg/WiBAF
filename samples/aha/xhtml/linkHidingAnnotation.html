<h2>Adaptive Link Hiding and Annotation</h2>
<p>AHA! changes the presentation of links of the class "conditional" and "unconditional". Conditional links can become good, neutral or bad; unconditional links are always good or neutral. The default presentation uses the colors blue, purple and black for good, neutral and bad. As a result, the blue and purple colors that people are used to on the Web are what AHA! presents.</p>
<p>In order for link classes to create the desired presentation color AHA! defines that presentation through a style sheet. In the XHTML+AHA!format the stylesheet is inserted in the header of the page. In the standard XHTML format the stylesheet can be an external file. The text-decoration is set to "none" which leads to link anchors that are not underlined. The link colors are only dependent on the link class. The style sheet defines the colors, independent of the browser. In order to achieve this the colors are defined for visited as well as unvisited links. The "good" versus "neutral" or "blue" versus "purple" choice is made by the AHA! engine, based on the value of the attribute "visited" of the concept that corresponds to the page the link leads to. The choice between "good" and "bad" depends on a Boolean expression, called "requirement" for the link destination. That expression is part of the domain and adaptation model.</p>
