            <p>
                The conditional inclusion of objects in AHA! follows a recursive scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a page is retrieved it is first turned into an XML stream that is parsed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conditionally included objects are identified through the &lt;object&gt; tag, a tag that exists in html and xhtml. For different xml formats a different tag can be used. For smil multimedia documents the &lt;ref&gt; tag is used instead of the &lt;object&gt; tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                When an &lt;object&gt; tag is encountered with an object of a special "aha/text" type, the AHA! engine performs the following procedure:
            </p>
            <li>
                The name of the "object" should be a concept for which the domain model specifies an attribute "showability" with a "casegroup" construct that specifies which resource to include, depending on the value of the "showability" attribute.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the resource that is actually included the corresponding concept is determined (this is done in the same way as for a page). The rules associated with that concept are executed. This creates user model updates. Rules may trigger other rules, and as a result several attributes of several concepts may be updated. There is also a danger that the rule execution may enter an infinite loop.
            </li>
            <li>
                The contents of the resource is inserted into the parse stream. The resource should contain a valid xml document with a root element. As a result it is not possible to directly include a non-textual object. But the xml document may of course consist of a single tag to include any type of object.
            </li>
            <p>
                There are some interesting consequences of inserting the included resource into the parse stream rather than including it directly into the output stream:
            </p>
            <li>
                Not only the page, but also the page with the conditional &lt;object&gt; replaced by the contents of the included resource must be syntactically correct. For the page this is required in order to be able to author the page using xml authoring tools. For the page with the included resource this is required by the xml parser.
            </li>
            <li>
                The part of the page after the included object and also the included resource are adapted using the user model as it is after the object inclusion. In contrast, the part of the page before the included object is adapted using the user model as it was before the object inclusion. Each time an object is included on the page the user model is updated and the rest of the page is adapted using the new user model.
            </li>
            <li>
                The included resource may conditionally include other objects, perhaps even include itself. This does not necessarily mean that there will be an infinite loop of recursive object inclusion. After each inclusion the user model has changed and the included resource for the same concept may be different. Of course there could be an infinite object inclusion loop, so as an author you not only have to be on the lookout for infinite loops in the rule engine but also in the object inclusions.
            </li>
        </main>
