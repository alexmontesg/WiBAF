<b>Warning:</b>
If you see this text it means you are not viewing the page through
the AHA! system.

<h2>What you need to know first:</h2>
<p>
In order to enjoy learning about and using
AHA!, please go over these instructions on how to deal with differences
between computing environments and browsers.
</p>

<p>
When you installed the AHA! distribution on your own system,
going through the tutorial is a good way to check whether the
system is functioning properly.
</p>

<p>There are a number of things you should pay attention to
when installing AHA! and using it, either as an end-user or as an author:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
AHA! is implemented entirely in Java, and works with the Java-based
webserver Tomcat and with Java servlets. You need recent versions of
Tomcat and of the Java SDK to make AHA! work. On the browser side
you should use recent versions to ensure full support of (X)HTML and
HTTP. If you experience problems with AHA! in combination with your
browser, please make sure you access the AHA! server right after
starting the browser (without visiting any other pages).
Some browsers, especially Internet Explorer, sometimes do not work
with AHA! after their internal memory has become corrupted through
visits to other Websites. There is no problem when AHA! is the first
site you visit.
</li>
<li>
AHA! provides <em>content adaptation</em> by conditionally
including fragments and <em>link adaptation</em> by conditionally
changing the color of link anchors. The adaptation is performed
each time a page is requested from the server.
With most browsers a page is <em>not</em> requested from the server
when the user navigates through the browsing history (using the
<em>back</em> and <em>forward</em> buttons). Also, when a page is
opened in a new browser window only the newly opened window shows
adaptation. The other window will continue to show the previous page
in its "old" state. Thus, as an author you should be aware that users
will not see any new adaptations when they navigate through the history.
The AHA! distribution contains a Javascript program "autoreload.js"
to circumvent the problem in the case of history navigation.
But as Javascript is not browser-independent
the use of this program is at your own risk.
This tutorial does not use the autoreload trick.
</li>
<li>
The <em>link adaptation</em> is performed through the use of
a <em>style sheet</em>. The browser must be configured to accept
colors which the html page requests. With most browsers this is the
default setting.
In this tutorial you will see that links are sometimes <em>blue</em>
and sometimes <em>purple</em>. These colors are determined by the
style sheet, not by the browser's history mechanism.
Links may also be <em>black</em> (actually <em>dark grey</em>)
meaning that according to the adaptive application the user is not
ready to follow them.
You may also see <em>bright red</em> or <em>dark red</em> links;
they point to pages that are not part of the tutorial.
</li>
<li>
AHA! pages can (but need not) have a <em>header</em> and/or
<em>footer</em>,
showing a progress report and access to forms for changing the
user profile, color preferences or password, or to log out.
If this header does not show up when you expect it, it probably
means that the page was not served through AHA! but straight
through the web server. (As a result there is then no adaptation.)
</li>
<li>
AHA! runs on any full implementation of the Java 2 platform.
It is frequently tested on Microsoft Windows (2000 and XP)
and Linux. Linux is the preferred platform, not just because it
is Open Source like AHA! itself, but also because it is better
at multitasking. This is especially noticeable on dual cpu machines.
AHA! can be used on slow computers with little memory.
(We have tested it on a Pentium 166 with 32 MB ram running Windows'98.)
However, for an enjoyable experience a faster server is recommended.
We find the performance on a laptop with Pentium III 650 sufficient
for a single-user application.
You can judge the performance of a reasonably fast server by using
the AHA! tutorial on the AHA! website,
which uses Linux on a dual Athlon MP 2000+ with 1GB of ram.
