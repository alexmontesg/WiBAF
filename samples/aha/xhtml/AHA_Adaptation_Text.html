        Regarding the content level adaptation fragments can have an associated <i>requirement</i>. This is a Boolean expression that decides whether the fragment should be included or not. In AHA! a fragment can be a part of an html or xhtml page. In that case the requirement is also part of the page, using an &lt;if&gt; tag. A fragment can also be an object, stored in a separate file. In that case the requirement is stored inside the combined domain and adaptation model, and the inclusion also triggers the adaptation engine to perform more user model updates.

        Regarding the link level adaptation AHA! checks a condition associated with the destination of a link in order to decide whether the link is "desirable". Depending on the status of the link destination the link anchor will be of the class "good", "neutral" or "bad". By default this results in the link anchor being blue, purple or black.
