<h2>Welcome to AHA! tutorial</h2> 
<p>It has been created with the AHA! version providing support to <b><i>Learning Styles</i></b>.</p>
<p>The material for this application, called "AHAtutorialLS", is taken from the AHA! "tutorial" provided by prof. Paul De Bra. 
"tutorial" is also included in this AHA! distribution however it does not have support to learning styles. 
(To read the "tutorial" you should go to AHA! configurator, select an option "Convert concept list from XML file to internal format", 
enter author "debra" and the course name to convert "tutorial". Then go to "http://localhost:8080/aha/tutorial/" page.)</p> 
<p>"AHAtutorialLS" describes the steps to install and to configure AHA!, the system's functionality and it's architecture. 
While applying different strategies for "AHAtutorialLS" using the AHA! authoring tool "GraphAuthor" you will see how 
the tutorial can be presented to the users with different preferences (corresponding to different learning styles). 
As well you will see how the user's preferences can be inferred through observing his browsing behaviour.</p> 
<p>You will be given a choice between more textual or more pictorial material describing the same concepts.</p>
<p>On the left side of the application pages you can see the conceptual structure or the table of contents for "AHAtutorialLS". 
The indentation indicates chapters, subchapters, etc.. 
You can navigate freely through the application selecting the items on the left side.
The user with "global" style will be suggested to read the higher level concepts (overview pages) before going into details 
while the user with "analytic" style will be suggested to read the details for the selected concepts.</p>
<p>You can switch between the instructional strategies changing the parameters of your user model through the special form 
link to which is given in the header of the application pages <a href="LS-form.frm">"Form to change your preferences"</a>.</p>
