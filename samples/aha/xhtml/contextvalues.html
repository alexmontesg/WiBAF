<p>The values that you may have or wish to change are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Document Base</em>: for example, "c:\aha" (this should be the
full pathname of the directory where you unpacked the AHA! zipfile).
</li>
<li>
<em>Path</em>: "/aha". In theory this can be any string you want.
We recommend "/aha" because this makes all AHA! paths start with
the word "/aha" and this is also the assumption we made in this
tutorial, which is accessible through /aha/AHAtutorialLS/
only if "/aha" is chosen as the path value.
<br />
Note that an empty path "/" is allowed in TomCat. It means that
all pathnames not explicitly configured to refer to another context
will be handled by AHA!. However, such context already exists and
AHA! can thus only be configured to use "/" by modifying that
existing context instead of creating a new one.
<br />
Also note that the "path" is part of a URL, and must thus be
written with a forward slash (/), not a backslash (\) like
for directories in Windows.
</li>
<li>
<em>Reloadable</em> (Context Properties):
True or False. When you set this value to True
the TomCat server will notice changes to AHA!'s (web.xml) configuration file.
This makes the installation procedure a bit smoother but causes
overhead. For a long-term AHA! installation it is best to set this
value to False.
</li>
<li>
<em>Use Naming</em>: This must be set to True. It enables a naming
feature that AHA! uses to read its own configuration.
</li>
<li>
<em>Reloadable</em> (Loader Properties): True or False.
When you set this value to True the TomCat server will notice
changes to AHA!'s class files. This enables you to experiment with
changes in the AHA! software without the need to restart the server
after each compile phase. But it generates overhead so for a
long-term AHA! installation it is best to set this value to False.
</li>
<li>
<em>Session ID Initializer</em>: This must be a unique string,
but can otherwise be anything. We have used "AHADISTR20" as an example.
</li>
</ul>
