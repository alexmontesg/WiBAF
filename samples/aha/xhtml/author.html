<h2>Authoring AHA! Applications</h2>

<p>
Authors in AHA! are special users, created by the manager
(who installs AHA!).
As an author you can access the authoring tools and your account
information through the
<a href="/aha/AuthorWorkplace" target="_blank"
class="unconditional">"Author Workplace"</a>.
</p>
<p>
Creating AHA! applications involves four main steps:
writing <a href="pages.xhtml" class="conditional">pages</a>,
creating a <a href="concepts.xhtml" class="conditional">conceptual
structure</a> of the aplication,
defining the
adaptation rules,
and defining the look and feel or layout of the application.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For each application you must create a directory tree of which the root
(like "AHAtutorialLS" for this tutorial) we will refer to as the "course"
(for historical reasons).
In the root directory you must create an "index.html" file
with a login form and a link to another file to register as a new user.
In this tutorial this file is "Registration.html".
The forms must adhere to the login form syntax
which is fairly obvious from looking at the tutorial version.
From the forms the servlets "Login", "Register" or "Anonymous"
are called. Some form elements create variables that can
be retrieved and used in a
<a href="headerfooter.xhtml" class="conditional">header or footer</a>.
Additional elements can be added. They will create attributes
for the <tt>personal</tt> pseudo-concept in the
<a href="usermodel.xhtml" class="conditional">user model</a>.
</li>
<li>
AHA! version 2.0 requires pages to be written in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/" target="_blank">XHTML</a>, the standard
markup language defined by the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">World Wide Web Consortium</a>.
We have a brief explanation of the differences between the "old"
plain html and <a href="xhtml.xhtml" class="conditional">xhtml</a>.
AHA! 2.0 added some tags to this language for the generation of optional
<a href="headerfooter.xhtml" class="conditional">headers and footers</a>
and for the
<a href="fragments.xhtml" class="conditional">conditional inclusion
of fragments</a>.
In AHA! 3.0 the standard XHTML "object" tag can be used to achieve
the same functionality (and more) without using an AHA!-extended document
format.
</li>
<li>
Each application deals with
<a href="concepts.xhtml" class="conditional">concepts</a>.
In the simplest case each page is a concept and vice versa.
But often you wish to consider "higher level" concepts.
AHA! comes with a "high level" graph author tool
to define the structure of concepts and pages.
You can define <em>relationships</em> of different types between
concepts. The tool generates the rules
<if expr="AHAtutorialLS.DomainAdaptationModel.knowledge&gt;50">
<block>
event-condition-action rules
</block>
<block>
adaptation rules
</block>
</if>
from this graph.
</li>
<li>
The adaptation in AHA! is a two-stage process.
As an author you define rules
that translate user interactions (page accesses) into
<a href="usermodel.xhtml" class="conditional">user model</a> updates.
The user model instance is then used to determine how the presentation
is adapted. There are three ways to author the adaptation rules:
you can generate rules
from concept relationships using the graph author,
you can manually create rules
using the concept editor,
or you can manually edit an XML file containing the concepts and adaptation rules.
</li>
<li>
An additional part of AHA! consists of <em>forms</em> for letting end-users
change their user model. There is a
Form Editor
through which you can define such forms and thus control which parts
of the user model an end-user can update and which part remains under
strict control of the AHA! system. For updates to <em>color preferences</em>
and <em>knowledge about concepts</em> there are standard forms that
can be accessed through the
<a href="headerfooter.xhtml" class="conditional">header or footer</a>.
</li>
<li>
For educational applications AHA! also offers the possibility
to present and evaluate multiple-choice tests.
The tests can be randomized to avoid circulation of lists of answers
among students.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The authoring tools all interact with XML files stored in a special
directory for "author files". This directory, called "graphauthorfiles" in
the AHA! configuration file is predefined as "/author/authorfiles".
When you make changes to these files (with or without AHA! tools) you
need to convert the XML files to AHA!'s internal format,
as described on the <a href="manager.xhtml" class="conditional">manager page</a>.
<br />
Note that for the Form Editor
you need to (manually) copy or move the created files to the directory
containing the pages of your application.
</p>

<p>
Warning: the graph author <em>generates</em> a file that can be read by the
concept editor, but it
does not read these files. Changes made to the concept/rule structure
in the concept editor are lost when you later make changes using the graph author.
