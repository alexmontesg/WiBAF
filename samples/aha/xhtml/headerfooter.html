<h2>Headers and Footers</h2>

<p>
Headers and footers are contained in XML files (type="text/xml")
that are included in a page using the <tt>object</tt> tag.
They must conform to the "headerfooter" DTD that is located
in /aha/AHAstandard/headerfooter.dtd (where /aha is the
<em>path</em> parameter in the
<a href="ahacontext.xhtml" class="conditional">AHA! configuration</a>).
The DTD mentions the tags that are allowed in headers and footers.
Besides the tags you can only add plain text. Any HTML tags must
be hidden inside <tt>&lt;![CDATA[...]]&gt;</tt> constructs.
The headers and footers of this tutorial should give some idea
of what to do with headers and footers. Below is a brief list of the
(meaning of the) tags that can appear in headers and footers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A first group of tags consists of <em>variables</em>.
In the header shown to the end-user the variable will be replaced by
its value. (These variables are actually attributes of a "personal"
pseudo-concept in the
<a href="usermodel.xhtml" class="conditional">user model</a>.
The possible variables are:
<ul>
<li>
<em>username</em>: The name of the end-user (if this is a field present
in the registration form. The variable is used as follows:
<pre>
&lt;variable&gt;&lt;username/&gt;&lt;/variable&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<em>loginid</em>: The user id entered in the registration form.
(Anonymous users are assigned a special unique anonymous id.)
</li>
<li>
<em>university</em>: This field is used for on-line courses offered
to students from different institutes. When available this user model
variable can not just be printed in the header or footer but also be
used to conditionally include fragments of information that are
relevant only for students of a certain university.
</li>
<li>
<em>department</em>: Like university this field can be used to distinguish
between groups of users.
</li>
<li>
<em>course</em>: The name of the current application (named "course" for
historical reasons).
</li>
<li>
<em>coursename</em>: In the registration form the application can be given
a "title" that is displayed in the header or footer.
(The tag "title" is already used in XHTML so we had to use a different
name for implementation reasons.)
</li>
<li>
<em>numberdone</em>: The number of pages in this application which the
user has visited.
</li>
<li>
<em>numbertodo</em>: The number of pages in this application which the
user has not yet visited.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The second group of tags are called <em>handlers</em>.
They create a link anchor through which the end-user can access
specially generated pages.
<ul>
<li>
<em>logout</em>: When the end-user clicks on this link the session is ended.
The handler is used as follows:
<pre>
&lt;handler&gt;
&lt;handlername&gt;&lt;logout/&gt;&lt;/handlername&gt;
&lt;linkdescription&gt;Logout (or any other text)&lt;/linkdescription&gt;
&lt;/handler&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<em>colorsettings</em>: This link will access a form through which the
end-user can change the color scheme for links.
</li>
<li>
<em>knowledgesettings</em>: This link will access a form that lets the
end-user change the "knowledge" user model attribute of all concepts that
have such attribute and for which that attribute is not marked as read-only.
</li>
<li>
<em>passwordsettings</em>: This link will access a form to change the
end-user's password. Anonymous users cannot have a password.
</li>
<li>
<em>done</em>: This link will access a page showing all the pages the
end-user has read. Each page name is a link to that page.
</li>
<li>
<em>todo</em>: This link will access a page showing all the pages the
end-user has not (yet) read. Each page name is a link to that page.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Note</b>: The syntax for headers and footers is considered
<em>deprecated</em>. Headers and footers will most likely be defined
in different ways in future versions of AHA!.
