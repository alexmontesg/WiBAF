<h2>Conditional Inclusion of Fragments</h2>

<p>
AHA! lets you conditionally include or hide parts of a page.
The condition is an expression using attributes of (user model) concepts
and constants. The condition is included in an <tt>if</tt> tag.
One or two <tt>block</tt> tags are used for the conditional fragments.
They correspond to a "then" and "else" construct in programming languages.
An example:
<pre>
&lt;if expr="tutorial.menus.show=1"&gt;
&lt;block&gt;
This part is included when in application "tutorial"
the attribute "show" of concept "menus" has the value 1.
&lt;/block&gt;
&lt;block&gt;
This optional second part is included when the first part
is not included.
&lt;/block&gt;
&lt;/if&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Conditions can contain Boolean combinations of expressions,
like:
<pre>
"tutorial.pages.knowledge&amp;gt;50 and tutorial.fragments.knowledge&amp;lt;30"
</pre>
It would have been nice to be able to write &lt; and &gt; instead of
&amp;lt; and &amp;gt; but unfortunately this would confuse the XML parser.
<br />
If strings are used in expressions they must be put in single quotes ('),
so as to not confuse the quotes with the double quotes (") around the
whole expression.
