<h2>Creating the AHA! Context</h2>
<p>We assume that you have the TomCat server
<if expr="AHAtutorialLS.firstconfig.knowledge==0">
<block>
(for instance Sun's version JWDSP from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html"
target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html</a>)
</block>
</if>
installed and running.
You need to create a "context" for AHA! so that TomCat knows where
the documents and servlets of AHA! are located.
</p>

<p>
In the sequel we will assume that the directory in which you unpacked the
AHA! zip archive is "c:\aha". On a Windows system "d:\aha" might also
be a good choice and on Linux "/usr/local/aha" or "$HOME/aha" might be
good choices. AHA! is completely independent of the directory in which
it is installed, but once installed it cannot easily be moved.
There is also no need to install AHA! in a location that is related
to where Tomcat is installed.
</p>

<p>
Creating the AHA! context involves the following steps:
</p>
<object name="AHAtutorialLS.contextsteps" type="aha/text" />
</main>
</body>
