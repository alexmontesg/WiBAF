<h2>Types of AHA! links</h2>
<p>In AHA! there are two types of links: links to a page and links to a concept.</p>
<p>Since in DM pages are linked to concepts AHA! can find out which concept corresponds to a page and which page corresponds to a concept.</p>
<p>Linking to a concept results in <i>adaptive link destinations</i> technique.</p>
<p>When a link is bound to a concept (rather than directly leading to a page) the adaptation engine uses a rule to determine which page to show, depending on the user model instance. 
A link to a concept may for instance lead to an introductory page for users who are missing some pre-requisite knowledge, whereas advanced users will see a more detailed description of the concept. 
Such adaptation is quite drastic, and most likely very obvious to the user.</p>
