            <h2>Concepts in AHA!</h2>

            <p>
                Each AHA! application consists of a set of <em>concepts</em>.
                For each <a href="pages.xhtml" class="conditional">page</a> and each <a href="objects.xhtml" class="conditional">conditionally included object</a>
                there should be a concept, but there may also be
                many other concepts. The concept structure can be created using the
                high level
                <a href="graphauthor.xhtml" class="conditional">graph author tool</a>,
                the low level
                <a href="concepteditor.xhtml" class="conditional">concept editor</a>
                or by directly editing the XML file that contains the application's
                concept structure.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> Even when you use a high-level authoring tool like
                the <a href="graphauthor.xhtml" class="conditional">graph author</a>,
                we recommend that you study the structure of concepts in AHA!.
            </p>

            <p>
                AHA! stores concepts in three formats: an authoring format (which
                is XML) and two internal formats (one XML and one mySQL).
                The structure of concepts is always the same and independent of
                the representation format. Each concept contains the following elements:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>name</em>: Every concept must have a unique name, which in AHA! must
                    be a single word (alphanumeric and starting with a letter).
                    In expressions (as shown below) concepts are prefixed with the name
                    of the AHA! application (like "tutorial") to make them unique
                    on the server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>description</em>: It is possible to add a description to each concept.
                    Currently the description can only be plain text, and is not used by
                    AHA! in any way. It just serves for authors to remind themselves of
                    the purpose for creating the concept.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>resource</em>: Concepts can be <em>abstract</em> or <em>associated with a page</em>. For such page concepts a URL needs
                    to be specified. For a local file such as the current page this URL
                    looks like:
                    <pre>
file:/AHAtutorialLS/xml/concepts.xhtml
</pre>
                    (Note that all local file URLs are relative to the <em>document base</em>
                    specified in the
                    <a href="ahacontext.xhtml" class="conditional">AHA! context</a>.)
                    <br />
                    A resource can refer to a page on a different website,
                    using the <tt>http</tt> protocol (instead of <tt>file</tt>).
                    Accessing such a known remote page triggers
                    <a href="usermodel.xhtml" class="conditional">user model</a> updates
                    just like with local pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>title</em>: This is the name used for this concept in automatically
                    generated lists (usually of links).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>hierarchy</em>: concepts can be part of a hierarchy, which has
                    the application's "toplevel" concept as the root. The hierarchy has
                    three sub-elements: <em>firstchild</em> is the name of the first
                    child of the current concept, if that exists; <em>nextsib</em>
                    is the name of the next sibling in the hierarchy, if that exists;
                    <em>parent</em>is the name of the parent concept, if that exists.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>attributes</em>: For each concept AHA! stores a number of attributes that
                    may be different for every concept. Every attribute has a number of
                    properties and a set of
                    <span class="DomainAdaptationModel-visited"> event-condition-action rules</span>.
                    The properties are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <em>name</em>: Each attribute has a name, like <em>access</em>, <em>suitability</em>, <em>knowledge</em>, <em>visited</em>, <em>interest</em>,
                            etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>type</em>: An attribute can be a Boolean, integer or string.
                            While in a previous AHA! version only the type "integer" existed,
                            with only values between 0 and 100, no such restriction exists in
                            version 2.0 or later.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>isPersistent</em>: Each time the end-user accesses a page some
                            attributes of concepts are updated. Attributes can be used to store
                            some value temporarily during the rule execution (isPersistent=false)
                            or can be remembered in the user model (isPersistent=true).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>isSystem</em>: While you can create arbitrarily many different
                            attributes for each concept there are a few attributes that have
                            a special function in AHA!, and that should be marked with
                            isSystem=true. At the moment these attributes are: <em>access</em>,
                            which is a non-persistent Boolean attribute that temporarily becomes
                            true when the resource associated with the concept is accessed,
                            <em>visited</em>, which is a persistent Boolean attribute that
                            becomes true when the resource associated with the concept is accessed,
                            <em>suitability</em>, which is a Boolean attribute (that can be
                            persistent or not) that determines whether the concept is considered
                            desirable (and linked to with GOOD or NEUTRAL color) or undesirable
                            (and linked to with BAD color),
                            and <em>showability</em>, which is an attribute used for selecting
                            conditionally included objects.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>isChangeable</em>: AHA! contains a <a href="formeditor.xhtml" class="conditional">form editor</a>
                            to create forms through which an end-user can update her user model.
                            Only attribute of concepts marked as changeable can be included
                            in such forms. The standard form to change knowledge values also
                            uses the <em>isChangeable</em> property to decide which concepts to show.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>description</em>: Like with concepts you can add a description
                            to each attribute to indicate the meaning of the attribute.
                            This description is not used by AHA! in any way.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <em>default</em>: This field indicates the initial value of the attribute.
                            It is assigned once for persistent attributes and repeatedly for
                            non-persistent attributes. The attribute <em>suitability</em> is a good
                            example of a volatile attribute that typically has an expression as default.
                            An example would be:
                            <pre>
tutorial.enduser.knowledge &gt; 50 and tutorial.concepts.knowledge &lt; 40
</pre>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="DomainAdaptationModel-visited"> event-condition-action rules</span>:
                    With every attribute of every concept
                    you can associate arbitrarily many
                    <span class="DomainAdaptationModel-visited"> event-condition-action rules</span>
                    that define how a page access results in user model updates.
                    <span class="DomainAdaptationModel-not-visited">These rules are actually <em>event-condition-action rules</em>.</span>
                    The rules are triggered by an <em>event</em> which is typically the
                    access of a page.
                    The rules contain a <em>condition</em> and an <em>action</em>.
                    Writing these rules is non-trivial.
                    The <a href="graphauthor.xhtml" class="conditional">graph author tool</a>
                    can releave you of this task.
                    The complete concept and rule structure for this AHA! tutorial
                    is created using this graph author tool.
