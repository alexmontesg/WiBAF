<h2>Conditional Inclusion of Objects</h2>

<p>
AHA! 3.0 introduces a new use of the standard XHTML
<tt>object</tt> tag: the conditional inclusion of (XML) files.
Unlike with the <a href="headerfooter.xhtml" class="conditional">headers
and footers</a> that are unconditionally included, the
<tt>object</tt> tag with <tt>aha/text</tt> type.
An example:
<pre>
&lt;object name="tutorial.conditionalobject" type="aha/text"&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The <tt>conditionalobject</tt> must be the name of a concept
belonging to the application <tt>tutorial</tt>.
Using the authoring tools you can create Boolean expressions
that determine which file will be included in the page,
at the place where the
<tt>object</tt> tag appears in the source.
</p>

<p>
A conditionally included file (through the <tt>object</tt> tag)
must be an XML fragment with one root element. It is inserted
into the parse stream of the page in which it is included.
The file may contain <tt>object</tt> tags itself, causing more
conditionally included objects to be considered.
</p>

<p>
When an object is included, the access to its concept causes the
<if expr="AHAtutorialLS.DomainAdaptationModel.knowledge&gt;50">
<block>
event-condition-action rules
</block>
<block>
adaptation rules
</block>
</if>
associated with that concept to be triggered.
This generates <a href="usermodel.xhtml" class="conditional">user model</a>
updates, that in turn influence how the remainder of the page is adapted.
When these rules not only evaluate which file to include but indeed do
generate user model updates, it can cause strange adaptation effects
because the part of the page above the object and the part below
the object are adapted to a different user model state.
