In the browser you go to the address /aha/Config.
The first time you do this a page appears that says
"Installing Configuration file".
This step actually executes a servlet that creates the AHA!
configuration files containing the information you entered
when <a href="ahacontext.xhtml" class="conditional">creating
the AHA! context</a> for TomCat.
</li>
<li>
Because the first step overwrites the initial configuration file,
the next step only works if you configured the AHA! context to be
reloadable. If you click on the "Configuration" link you go to "AhaConfig" page.
If the context is not reloadable you have to restart the TomCat server
first.
<if expr="AHAtutorialLS.ahacontext.knowledge==0">
<block>
(Execute shutdown.sh and
startup.sh on Linux or shutdown.bat and startup.bat on Windows.)
</block>
</if>
<br />
You can always go to the "AhaConfig" page later, using the
link /aha/Config.
You will never see the "Installing Configuration file" page again.
</li>
<li>
When you try to go to AhaConfig page you are prompted for a
login and password. Initially you should use "aha" as login and no password.
</li>
<li>
The first thing to do when shown the AhaConfig page is to select
"Manager Configuration" and then select "Change an existing user"
from the Manager administration menu,
in order to change the "aha" <em>login</em> to a name you prefer,
and to add a password.
This is important for security reasons, because everyone who knows
AHA! also knows that it comes with "aha" as the default manager
without a password.

Through the "Author menu" you can create authors
and assign applications to authors.
